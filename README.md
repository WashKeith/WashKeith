## I am a rising Junior majoring in Data Science, with a past internship at Wabtec Corporation as a Data Analyst. In my role, I focused on using SQL and PowerBI to perform exploratory analysis and visualization on large datasets, uncovering valuable insights and supporting data-driven decision-making for my company. As I advance in my academic and professional journey, I am keen on to expanding my expertise in data engineering and machine learning. I will be working on various projects to deepen my understanding and application of different AI/ML frameworks as well as data engineering tools. Through these projects, I aim to enhance my technical skills, solve complex problems, and immerse myself in the field of Data Science
